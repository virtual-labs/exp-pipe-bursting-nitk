#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|See the displayed objectives and apparatus used then click on next button |Display objective and apparatus used |Recall the experiment
2.|Click on pipe then click on OK to proceed, click on next button. |Display the pipe to be tested must have nearly uniform ends. |To check for uniform ends.
3.|Click on the bottom flange and then insert the wedge ring at one end and clamp the other end similarly then click on vent bolts in the bottom flange to tighten it, then place the sample in the setup, click on next button |Display insert the bottom flange in the pipe and then wedge ring one end and then mount the top flange in the pipe and clamp it with the help of bolts provided. This causes gripping of the flange to the pipe. |To prepare the sample of pipe for the test.
4.|Start the pump by clicking on the green button for air escape then stop it by clicking on red button, click on the top volt bolts to tighten it, click on next button. |Display start the power pack to pump in oil. |For escape of air from the pipe.
5.|Click on green button to start the machine and note the Ultimate Tensile Strength of pipe, click on next button. |Display start the machine, as the pressure nears to the theoretical pressure, slow down the pumping rate and wait for appearance of longitudinal cracks and consequent sudden drop in pressure. |To obtain Ultimate Tensile Strength of pipe.
6.|Note down the observation and calculate the Von-Mises Stress by using the given formula. |Display observations and calculations. |To obtain the Von-Mises Stress.
